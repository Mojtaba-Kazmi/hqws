## What is Cladding?
Cladding is a protective and decorative layer applied to the exterior of buildings, providing insulation, durability, and aesthetic appeal. In Adelaide, where weather conditions can be unpredictable, cladding acts as a shield, preventing damage from extreme temperatures, moisture, and UV exposure.

## Benefits of Cladding
### 1. **Enhanced Durability**
Cladding adds an extra layer of protection, preventing structural damage from environmental factors like rain, wind, and heat.

### 2. **Improved Energy Efficiency**
Quality cladding materials help regulate indoor temperatures, reducing heating and cooling costs.

### 3. **Low Maintenance**
Unlike traditional wall surfaces, cladding requires minimal upkeep, saving homeowners and businesses time and money.

### 4. **Aesthetic Appeal**
With various textures, colors, and materials available, cladding enhances the architectural style of any building.

## Types of Cladding Materials
Choosing the right cladding material depends on budget, style, and functional needs. Here are some popular options:

- **Timber Cladding** – Natural and eco-friendly, adding warmth to any property.
- **Vinyl Cladding** – Cost-effective and low-maintenance, ideal for modern homes.
- **Brick Cladding** – Classic and durable, offering long-lasting protection.
- **Metal Cladding** – Sleek and contemporary, often used for commercial properties.
- **Stone Cladding** – Luxurious and robust, enhancing property value.
- **Fibre Cement Cladding** – Fire-resistant and weatherproof, perfect for Australian conditions.
